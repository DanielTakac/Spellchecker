# Spellchecker

This is a simple C# console application that checks if a given word is in the English dictionary. If the word is not found, the program will suggest a few similar words with their Hamming distance.

### How it works
The program takes a word as input and removes any non-alphabetic characters and converts it to lowercase. It then checks if the word is in the English dictionary. If the word is not found, the program suggests a few similar words based on their Hamming distance. The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which two strings differ, and is used to measure the similarity between words.
